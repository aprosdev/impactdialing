##
# Use an instance of this class to act on user requests
# to change their plan. It currently supports these plans:
#
# - trial (pseudo-plan)
# - basic
# - business
# - pro
# - per_minute
#
# Transitioning from per_minute to basic, business or pro is not allowed.
# Transitioning to Trial from anything is not allowed.
# Otherwise, this class handles all upgrades, downgrades and buying of minutes.
#
# Example Usage:
#
#     manager = Billing::SubscriptionManager.new(provider_customer_id, record)
#     manager.update!('business', {callers_allowed: 5})
#     # assuming subscription.plan is 'trial', this will upgrade it to business and
#     # purchase 5 seats
#     # or
#     manager.update!('per_minute', {amount_paid: 75.0})
#     # assuming subscription.plan is 'trial' or 'per_minute', this will purchase minutes
#     # and eventually trigger an update to the account quota when the `charge.succeeded`
#     # event is processed.
#
