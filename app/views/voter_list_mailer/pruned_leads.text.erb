<%= pluralize(@results[:removed_leads], 'lead') %> and <%= pluralize(@results[:removed_numbers], 'phone number') %> were removed from your campaign.

Your list contained:

- <%= @results[:total_rows] %> rows of data
- <%= @results[:total_leads] %> valid lead IDs

<% if @results[:invalid_rows].size > 0 -%>
Of <%= @results[:total_rows] %> data rows, <%= @results[:invalid_rows].size %> contained invalid data.
Any rows from your upload that could not be processed are attached. Things to look for:

- incomplete or blank phone number fields
- very long rows (indicates an editing error prior to upload where multiple rows were combined into 1)
<% end -%>
