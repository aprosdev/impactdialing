##
# Provides methods for building queries and aggregating
# billable minutes usage.
#
# This class should not be used to build reports directly.
# Instead an instance of the class should be passed to
# a builder object that generates the needed report.
#
# Usage:
#     class MyReport
#       attr_reader :billable_minutes
#       def initialize(billable_minutes)
#         @billable_minutes = billable_minutes
#       end
#
#       def build
#         ...generate report...
#       end
#     end
#
#     billable_minutes = Reports::BillableMinutes.new(from_date_obj, to_date_obj)
#     report = MyReport.new(billable_minutes)
#     print report.build
#
